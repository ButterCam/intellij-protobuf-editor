# Protocol Buffers support for IntelliJ

This plugin provides editor support for Protocol Buffer files, including text
format.

This is a fork of Google's own internal editor that I helped build during my time there. Google released it
[here](https://github.com/google/intellij-protocol-buffer-editor) but does not plan to support it externally.

# Features
